# hotdogornot
Training an image classification model to classify whether an image is of a hot dog or not.

Using the pretrained model ResNet18 by microsoft, we change the final (output) layer to having 2 neurons (instead of 1000 that it was trained on).

Dataset used consists of photos of hotdogs, which is downloaded within the code.
